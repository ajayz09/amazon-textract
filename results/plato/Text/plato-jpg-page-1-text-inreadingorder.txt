1. This withholding tax applies to you if the dividend amount is partially or totally unfranked and you are
a) resident of Australia and your TFN or ABN has not been recorded by the share registry. TFN withholding tax is deducted from the gross unfranked portion of
the dividend at the highest marginal tax rate applying to personal income; or
b) non-resident of Australia. Non-resident withholding tax (30%) is deducted from the gross unfranked portion of the dividend unless you are a resident of a
country which has entered into a Double Taxation Agreement with Australia. In that case a lower rate (generally 15%) may apply.
3. The franking credit has been calculated at the rate of 30%.
To update your TFN, bank account and other details including self-certifying your tax residency under the Foreign Tax Compliance Act (FATCA) and the Common
